    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* NLP has become increasingly popular over the past few years, and NLP researchers have achieved very insightful insights  \n",
    "* The Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) is one of the most popular Python libraries for NLP\n",
    "* Regular Expressions are an important part of NLP, which can be used for pattern matching and filtering\n",
    "* Regular Expressions can become confusing, so make sure to use our provided cheat sheet the first few times you work with regex\n",
    "* It is strongly recommended you take some time to use regex tester websites to ensure you understand how changing your regex pattern affects your results when working towards a correct answer!\n",
    "* Feature Engineering is essential when working with text data, and to understand the dynamics of your text\n",
    "* Common feature engineering techniques are removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and n-grams\n",
    "* When diving deeper into grammar and linguistics, context-free grammars and part-of-speech tagging is important\n",
    "* In this context, parse trees can help computers when dealing with ambiguous words \n",
    "* _How_ you clean and preprocess your data will have a major effect on the conclusions you'll be able to draw in your NLP classification problems "
